          I discovered the importance of education during my college years as an
          Electronics and Communication student. Although I almost became an
          engineer, I chose a different path, using that experience to push
          myself further. I found success in the sales industry and earned a
          Masterâ€™s in Business Administration. Recently, I realized I needed a
          new challenge and decided to pursue a career as a Full-Stack Web
          Developer.
